In an effort to continue Mendicant University's tradition of mentoring and teaching, I will be holding open office hours on May 14 from 12:00 - 15:00 UTC. During office hours everyone in the community is encouraged to stop by and ask questions or pitch in. We can work on technical challenges, discuss new ideas or create your first pull request.

If you are interested in holding your own office hours, fork [mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org), create an activity and submit a pull request.
