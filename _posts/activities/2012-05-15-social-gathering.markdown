Please stop in and hang out on the `#mendicant` channel next Tuesday, 15 May at 15:00 UTC - it's our first gathering since the new direction for Mendicant was announced. There's no set agenda, it's just a chance to catch up on what we're working on or want to be working on, community gossip, **BABY PHOTOS**, photoshop lulz, and assorted other pastimes for a boring day at work or school!
