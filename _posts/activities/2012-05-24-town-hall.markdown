Mendicant University is run by and for its community.
Our town hall meetings provide a way for us to exchange ideas,
plan activities, and discuss important issues with one another
so that we can keep making this school better and better.

We strongly encourage both newcomers and active community 
members to participate in these meetings. They are meant to
be a welcoming place to get your questions answered about 
the school, to raise any concerns you have about how things
have been going, and also to get involved with the process
of running the school itself.

> Please join us on May 24 from 14:00-15:30 UTC. The central
> discussion topic for this meeting will 
> be **"Defining the culture of Mendicant University"**, but there
> will also be time for an open-ended roundtable discussion
> about all things Mendicant.
