On June 5 from 18:00-19:30 UTC, Gregory Brown will be running a 90-minute study session on technical writing. This session will focus on the general challenges
involved in communicating complex ideas through writing, and does not require
any special background in a particular field. This session will hopefully be interesting for both experienced and inexperienced writers.

All are welcome to come listen in, but those who wish to be actively involved in
the session are strongly encouraged to complete this [preliminary writing task](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/17/task-for-the-upcoming-technical-writing-session). Although the submission deadline has already passed, working on this exercise will make it easier for you to participate.

No matter what kind of work you do, improving your understanding of the
fundamentals of technical writing will make you a better
teacher AND a better learner. This session will hopefully be the first
of many on this very important topic.
