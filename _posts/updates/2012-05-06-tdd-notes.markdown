On 2012 May 03, Gregory Brown and Eric Hodel met to discuss various challenges
in test-driven development while encouraging the Mendicant University community 
to listen in and share their thoughts as well. The epic meeting lasted over three 
hours, covering the following topics:

* Testing code that depends on randomization
* Testing callbacks in a publish/subscribe system
* The challenges involved in UI-based acceptance testing
* Dealing with brittle tests and magic numbers
* Speeding up the refactoring feedback loop 

A detailed summary of the discussion as well as a full transcript from the
meeting are available over on the [Mendicant University wiki](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/TDD-study-session-%282012-May-03%29).
