A huge part of the challenge of creating a new [Mendicant
University](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Mendicant-University-roadmap),
is that we need to figure out how to collectively define our culture. This is
much harder to do in an open environment than it is in a closed one, and was
something we struggled with even when we ran our program in private.

As new folks join our community, they will inevitably want to know what sets us
apart from the thousands of other places online where they can learn and work
together with others. It is going to take us a lot of time and effort to come up
with a satisfying answer to that question, but we need to start working on it
right away.

While we are very much rebuilding our community from scratch, some ideas from
our past can provide a nice starting point for defining the future of Mendicant 
University. In particular, if you have not read the following articles, they may
help you understand our motivations for building this school in the first place:

* [Why does (Ruby) Mendicant University Exist?](http://blog.majesticseacreature.com/why-does-ruby-mendicant-university-exist)

* [Gregory Brown's vision for Mendicant University](http://blog.majesticseacreature.com/my-vision-for-mendicant-university)

* [Who should study at Mendicant University?](http://majesticseacreature.com/essays/2012/01/28/who-should-study-at-mendicant.html)

While all of these posts are somewhat dated, they should provide a good starting
place for conversations about what the culture of the new Mendicant University
community ought to be. We are trying to do something much deeper than simply
teaching technical skills, and no matter how much we change, we will always be
looking for ways to make a deeper impact on the world.

> We will set up a town hall meeting to discuss this topic soon, and hope to get
some community guidelines written up as soon as we can.
