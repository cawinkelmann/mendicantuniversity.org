> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

Hi everyone! Here comes another weekly dose of news about mendicant university. All the recent changes have made the university move forward again and this are some of the events that happened this week.

#### What happened this week:

* The [Vanilla Forums](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org) were down for some time but the experience look good anyhow so they are here to stay at least for a bit more testing. Feel free to sign up and join to the conversations happening there. 

* [Anita](https://github.com/mendicant/anita) (our own IRC bot) is working now. Look for anitabot in #mendicant IRC channel in freenode.

* We held another social gathering in #mendicant channel in freenode. You can check [Anita's logs](http://anita.mendicantuniversity.org/mendicant/20120515..20120516).

#### Our plans for next week:

* We will hold a [session on technical writing](/updates/2012/05/16/preliminary-task-for-tech-writing.html) directed by Gregory Brown. [There is alredy an assignment](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/17/task-for-the-upcoming-technical-writing-session) for all of us that want to attend.

* There will be another [Town hall meeting](http://mendicantuniversity.org/activities/2012/05/24/town-hall.html) where we will discuss the [community guidelines](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/Community-guidelines) we have already drafted.


And that's mostly it. Stay tuned for another issue of the Unicorn's Horn next week and have fun! Go Unicorns!
