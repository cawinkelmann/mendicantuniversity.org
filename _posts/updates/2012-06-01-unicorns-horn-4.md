> The Unicorn's Horn is a weekly summary of what we have been up to lately at Mendicant University. It should come in handy for folks who want to keep up with what we are working on, but don't have time to read each and every one of our updates.

When Mendicant University was still a private community, most of the burden of organizing and executing courses and activities fell on Gregory Brown's shoulders. This was something we wanted to change by going public. While this week was rather calm activity-wise, the homesteaders are working to make the new Mendicant an easy community for someone to pitch an activity idea, organize it with those interested and run it publicly. 

#### What happened this week: ####

* We worked on defining and documenting how to organize activities. This is a work in progress so we are constantly looking to refine it and make it easier for all involved. Right now you can check our guides on [How to organize a study session](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/How-to-organize-a-study-session) and [How to post an activity to mendicantuniversity.org](https://github.com/mendicant/mendicantuniversity.org/wiki/How-to-post-an-activity-to-mendicantuniversity.org)

* Continued improvement on [Anita](https://github.com/mendicant/anita) (our own IRC bot) so that it's in a good shape for accepting contributions.

#### Upcoming Plans:

* Eric Gjertsen is running [open office hours on Monday, June 04](http://mendicantuniversity.org/activities/2012/06/04/office-hours-with-eric_gjertsen.html). Come to request code reviews or ask questions no matter your programming level on a first-come, first-serve basis.

* Greg will host a [Technical Writing Study Session on Tuesday, June 05](http://mendicantuniversity.org/activities/2012/06/05/technical-writing.html). All are welcome to come listen in, but those who wish to be actively involved in the session are strongly encouraged to complete this preliminary [writing task](http://forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/17/task-for-the-upcoming-technical-writing-session).

* Rafa de Castro is organizing a Reading Club for [Beautiful Visualization](forum.mendicantuniversity.org/discussion/21/reading-club-beautiful-visualization). It's still in the preparations stage so come show your interest.

* The Mendicant homesteaders will continue to work on whatever needs to be done to make the new Mendicant University a wonderful place to be. In particular, we will continue working on documentation explaining how to get involved, and how our school works.

That's all the news for this week. Stay tuned for another issue of the Unicorn's Horn next week and have fun! Go Unicorns!
