Hello Practicing Rubyist!

This week is one of the regularly scheduled off-weeks in our schedule,
so there isn't a new article for you to read just yet. If reading
through the many articles in Practicing Ruby's archives isn't exciting
enough for you this week, there are two other things that might be
interesting for you to work on.

## Build your own object-relational mapper

Next week's article will be a cheap counterfeit of ActiveRecord, with
some interesting design twists. My goal is to implement the Active
Record architectural pattern without necessarily doing things exactly
as the Rails library does it, because it is an interesting software
design challenge. 

After a couple days of working on this problem, I've found it to be an
awesome learning exercise, and want to encourage you to try this at
home! If you have some free time, try building a simple library that
wraps a low-level database wrapper (such as the sqlite3 gem), and
implements the following features:

- mapping of object attributes to database fields
- create, read, update, and destroy functionality for records
- simple association support
- simple validation support

Remember, the goal is to implement a library which makes it easy to
use the Active Record architectural pattern, it does not necessarily
need to look and feel like the ActiveRecord gem. For details on that
pattern, check out these links:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record

If you decide to work on this exercise, feel free to find me in the
#mendicant channel on Freenode to discuss strategies and ideas. I will
be working on my own implementation throughout the week, and will
publish my notes on it in Practicing Ruby 4.7 on Tuesday, June 5.

## Improve your technical writing

I honestly feel that my ability to write well has been more important
to my career than my ability to program well. For that reason, I have
decided I want to help others learn how to communicate complex
technical ideas through written works.

On Tuesday June 5 from 18:00-19:30 UTC, I will be hosting an open
study session on technical writing in the #mendicant channel on
Freenode. You can see details about the event via the link below,
and are welcome to join us if you'd like!

I hope you'll be able to participate in one or both of these
activities. But if you can't, don't worry about it. Practicing Ruby
will resume with more awesome content next week! As always, feel free
to read through the archives and stir up a discussion on any of the
articles that capture your interest: I love when readers share their
thoughts.

Thanks,
-greg
